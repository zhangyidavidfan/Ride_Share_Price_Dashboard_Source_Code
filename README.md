## Motivation
We live in an era of sharing economies; Ride Share is a huge part of that eco-system and is an extremely interesting one that is deeply tied with our lives today.

## Goal
My Goal for this project is two fold; On an exploration perpspective I am quite interested in seeing what are some interesting insights that we can find on people’s interaction with ride-share services. On an utility perspective, I would want to build a model that can help people better estimate how much commuting expense they’ll use through ride share services.

## FLow
Specficially in line with the exploration, I aim to challenge and verify some of the typical assumptions we have regarding ride-share pricing. Things such as weekdays, time of the day, weather and even neighborhood. I specifically want to look into these areas:

### Hypothesis 1
Peak hours and ride prices: My general hypothesis is that peak hours DO affect ride prices due to the high amount demand present.

### Hypothesis 2
Weekends and holidays: Similarly it would seem reasonable to assume an increase in fare during holidays because of the propensity of people to go out and have fun; However I would say that may not be absolute but dependent on whether the volume of daily commuters offsets that propensity.

### Hypothesis 3
Weather(percipitation, wind and temperature): I would pose it that severe weather condition might decrease fare as people are more unlikely to go out. However weather conditions such as rain that occured in the middle of the day may increase fare due to an increased demand.

### Hypothesis 4
Neighborhood: I believe that neighborhood will have an effect on ride-share prices at least for the selected few. For instance, more central are are likely going to be more expensive
